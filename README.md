# A Brief Summary of our Game

## Puzzletale: Masters of Myths

### By Jory, Michael, and Nicholas

#### Our game will be a simple puzzle piece RPG-esqe game. It'll
#### have the player do simple fill-in puzzles to make offensive
#### or defensive items in the midst of battle to square up againt
#### their foe. The puzzles themselves are currently gonna be pre-
#### built, however, if we can figure out how to make custom puzzles
#### with custom puzzle pieces, then that'll be the better option
#### since that makes for a lot more variation in battles since the
#### puzzles are always different in some way ot another.Once the 
#### player's done the battle against their foe, they'll be forced
#### to head to the next enemy to commence in another fight that's
#### been pre-built by us. Since our game's a mobile game, like most 
#### mobile games, this'll be a free-to-play game with simple micro-
#### transactions within it. With some other quality of life aspects
#### like achievements, a leaderboard, etc, on top of the main game
#### mechanics, that's a good summary of our future game in this 
#### class.
